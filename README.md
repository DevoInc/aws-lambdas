# About this repository

In the official documentation of Devo you can find several examples of use of AWS Lambda, 
this is the code of the zips found in those examples.

Each language (Node and Python, for now) have their own folder and their own README. 
In addition, the different versions of the compressed folders are available in the "dist" 
folder of each language, with almost finished examples ready to use
